“Shall I tell you the secret of the whole world? It is that we have only known the back of the world. We see everything from behind, and it looks brutal. That is not a tree, but the back of a tree.

In such a receptacle life will be cut to pieces. If we make cities which are trees, they will cut our life within to pieces.”
